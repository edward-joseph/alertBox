<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/edward-joseph/alertBox)

In fact, I needed a javascript library where I always wanted to create `alerts` and `popups` without losing any time. It's also really annoying to spend my time making different `popups` and `alerts` with different designs.

So I spent my time up:
* built a library just with javascript so libraries like jQuery no longer needed
* To make a warning message for myself and the users who are tired of writing long codes
* With just a few lines of code writing, you can create alerts and popups that even change their designs

Of course, your needs can not be addressed with this library alone, and maybe you need more than that, so I'm going to update this library to be able to meet the maximum needs.

In fact, I created this library alone, but I also asked some questions about the problem.
